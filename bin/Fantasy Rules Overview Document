Rules and Scoring Link: https://www.espn.com/fantasy/story/_/id/22335700/fantasy-baseball-espn-fantasy-baseball-101-settings

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Between 4 and 20 teams: I should probably generalize for this

10 teams is relatively standard.

Standard Roster:

Catcher: 1
1B: 1
2B: 1
SS: 1
3B: 1
MI: 1 (Filled by 2B or SS)
CI: 1 (Filled by 1B / 3B)
OF: 5
UTIL (any): 1
Pitchers: 9
Bench: 3 (on roster, but not in the starting lineup)

Usually a good idea to have 1, or 2 IR spots

You can stash injured players on IR for later in the season.

Check the site linked above for a detailed description of league
settings. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

Roto: Ranked by category, points are awarded according to the order in each category. In this way all categories are basically equal.

Head to Head Points: Categories have values, i.e. HR = 4, RBI = 1

Head to Head Most Categories: You want to win in as many categories 
as possible against a head to head apponent. You either win or you 
lose.

Head to Head Each Categories: A win loss or tie is accreddited in each category vs your apponent. These wins and losses accumulate over
time, and decide rankings I 

Season Points: Just a total of points. Different point categories
have different point values.

Teams and divisions exist. Less then 12, 2 are suggested, 12 or more
3 are suggested with either 1 or 3 wild card teams. (teams with the
best record)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Undropable List: This is a setting which prevents managers from dropping stars. The idea behind this is to prevent collusion between
a team trying to make the playoffs, and a team which is eliminated

Lineup changes: You can choose to either lock lineups on a weekly
or daily basis.

Weekly: Lineups need to be locked in before the first game on
Monday. (THIS IS REALLY BAD, MY ALGORITHM IS BEST BECAUSE IT 
DOESNT TAKE BREAKS).

Daily: Either lock individually at the scheduled game time (best)
or to lock when the first game starts (Way better then weekly).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Player Aquisition System:

Waivers: Players dropped from a team will be put on waivers for 1 or 
2 days. At which time, any team can put in a waiver claim for him. 
The team with the highest waiver priority that made a claim will
get the player and move to the bottom of the waiver queue. 

Free Agent Auction: Allows teams to bid on waivers based on a free
agent budget, called a FAAB. The highest blind bid gets the player.
(this might greatly overcomplicate my algorithm, but if done well
could give me a big advantage). Stretch Goal.

Season Aquisition Limit: Really bad for me, should not exist, do
not play in a league that has this.

Trade Deadline: Unlimited Trades are a must. The trade deadline can
be used to prevent manager collusion at the end of the season. I'm 
fairly indifferent on this topic.

Trade Review: I would prefer not to have trade review so I can make
last minute trades, but can be used to prevent collusion. I think 
I'm indifferent.

Keeper Rules: Keep players for the next season. N/A rn

Schedule: Wise to end the season before the final month of the season 
because many teams, sit / rest stars. Advised to wrap up the league
by Week 21 or 22.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Offline: Obvious. Basically N / A

Snake: Draft order reverses each round

Auction: Budget based. Get to bid on each player. Another Streatch
goal. I'm sure theres a good algorithm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Scoring:

Hitters: 1 point for each total base, run scored, stolen base, walk and RBI. -1 point for each strikeout.

Pitchers: 1 Point for every batter retired. 1 EXTRA point if its a strikeout. -1 point for walks and hits. Earned runs cost 2 points a piece. 5 points for wins and saves. -5 for Losses. They make a point to say that pitchers with a good K/BB are good.

There are a ton of different ways to do scoring. I should look into 
them. This is the default.


Categories are:

Hitters AVG, HR, RBI, SB, R

Pitchers: W, SV, K, ERA, WHIP

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:

I should pay a lot of attention to how many points each player is going to earn me per week, throughout the year. I need to win every
week, not just score the total points for the season.

Maybe instead of saying I need to win every week I need to win to win
enough weeks to win the playoffs, Then I need to win my matchups, in
order to win the title.

The more I look, Maybe Head-to-Head most categories would give me 
the greatest advantage to win the most games.
